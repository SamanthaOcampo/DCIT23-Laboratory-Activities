Laboratory Activities for DCIT23 - Computer Programming

Lab 1: This Java program is a basic employee information system that takes users' personal and professional information, computes their daily pay, and shows a summary.  It provides a hands-on introduction to Java basics, including variables, input/output, arithmetic operations, and object management.  It is ideal for demonstrating how simple Java logic may be applied to solve practical problems. 

Lab 2: This is an improved Lab 1 version.  It adds practical financial insights to the fundamentals.  It covers formatting, retirement calculation, salary calculation, input processing, and string manipulation.  It expands on your Java knowledge by using it in realistic financial situations.

Lab 3: This still connects with the first and second laboratory activities.  The use of conditional statements and role classification adds a deft layer of logic that makes our program much more similar to how actual HR systems function.  This covers modular salary logic, control flow, and defensive code. 

Lab 4: By using Java Swing, it converts the Employee Information System from a console-based interface to a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  It incorporates Event-Driven Programming, Business Logic, GUI Design, and User Input Validation.

Lab 5: Within a graphical user interface, this AWT-based Java Quiz Application serves as a lightweight multiple-choice test that assesses user knowledge and shows the final score.   This lab activity teaches you how to organize logic, create user-friendly flows, and handle input in real time—it's not just about syntax. 

Lab 6: With the usage of Swing, this Java task management application enables users to add and see items on their to-do lists in an easy-to-use graphical user interface.  It's an excellent illustration of dynamic data processing and modular interface design.  It's a good starting point for creating a basic project tracker or personal planner.

Midterm-Lab-Exam: The purpose of this command-line-based ticket management system is to simulate the way that entry-level IT service desks or tech support handle, monitor, and address user-reported problems.  It provides experience with loop-based menus, array management, input validation, and simple status monitoring.

Final-Lab-Exam: This Java GUI calculator is a visual, interactive application that allows users to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of typing commands in a console. It makes it easy and intuitive to calculate without typing formulas.
